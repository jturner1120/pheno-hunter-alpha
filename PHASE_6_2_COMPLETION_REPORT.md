## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### Operation Configuration System

```javascript
const OPERATION_CONFIGS = {
  update_stage: {
    label: 'Update Stage',
    icon: '🌱',
    description: 'Update growth stage for selected plants',
    requiresInput: true,
    inputType: 'select',
    inputOptions: ['seedling', 'vegetative', 'flowering', 'harvested'],
    estimatedTime: 2000,
    destructive: false
  },
  // ... additional operations
};
```

### Batch Processing Architecture

```javascript
const executeBulkOperation = async (operation, data) => {
  const batches = createBatches(selectedPlants, BATCH_SIZE);
  
  for (const batch of batches) {
    await processBatch(batch, operation, data);
    updateProgress(batch);
  }
};
```

### Progress Tracking System

```javascript
const progress = {
  total: plants.length,
  completed: [],
  failed: [],
  processing: []
};
```
