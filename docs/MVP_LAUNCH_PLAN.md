## 🎯 **The Reality Check Questions**

### **Before Building Any Feature:**
1. **Is this critical for launch?** (If no, defer)
2. **Will users pay for this?** (If unsure, defer)
3. **Can Firebase/Supabase handle this?** (If yes, use it)
4. **Does this help us learn about users?** (If no, defer)

### **Launch Decision Criteria:**
- [ ] Users can register and login
- [ ] Users can create, edit, view plants
- [ ] Users can upload images
- [ ] Users can track harvest data
- [ ] Payment system works
- [ ] No data loss bugs

**If all above = ✅, we ship. Everything else is iteration.**

## 🚀 **Action Plan: Next 48 Hours (ZERO COST)**

1. **Choose backend**: Firebase (has best free tier) - 30 minutes
2. **Set up Firebase project**: Free account, enable auth + Firestore - 1 hour  
3. **Deploy current app**: Push to Vercel with custom domain - 1 hour
4. **Test auth flow**: Get registration working - 2 hours

**Total time**: 4-5 hours  
**Total cost**: $0 (use free subdomain initially)

### **Week 1 Goals (Still FREE):**
- [ ] Users can register/login with Firebase Auth
- [ ] Basic plant data saves to Firestore  
- [ ] App deployed at phenohunter.vercel.app
- [ ] 2-3 alpha testers using it

**Only buy domain ($12) when you have users who love the alpha version.**

---

## 💡 **Ultra-Budget Tips**

### **Free Alternatives to Consider:**
- **Supabase**: Also has generous free tier (2 projects, 500MB DB)
- **PlanetScale**: Free MySQL database (5GB)
- **Vercel subdomain**: phenohunter.vercel.app (instead of custom domain)
- **GitHub Pages**: Free static hosting (alternative to Vercel)

### **Free Tools for Alpha:**
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics (free)
- **Error tracking**: Sentry (free tier: 5k errors/month)
- **Email**: EmailJS (free tier: 200 emails/month)
- **Forms**: Netlify Forms (free tier: 100 submissions/month)

### **When to Spend Money:**
- **Domain**: Only when users ask "what's the real URL?"
- **Paid plans**: Only when you hit free tier limits
- **Premium features**: Only when users request them
- **Marketing**: Only when organic growth slows

---

**Bottom Line**: You can run a full alpha for **$0/month** and only pay when you have users who justify the cost.
