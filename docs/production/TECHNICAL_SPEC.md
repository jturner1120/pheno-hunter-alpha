# Pheno Hunter - Production Technical Specification

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Current Status**: Feature-complete demo application with full UI/UX
**Production Gap**: Requires backend infrastructure for multi-user, web-deployed application
**Timeline**: 6-13 weeks depending on backend approach chosen
**Investment**: $75-500/month operational costs based on user scale

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Current Demo Architecture
```
Browser (Client-Side Only)
├── React Frontend
├── localStorage Data
└── Base64 Images
```

### Proposed Production Architecture
```
Frontend (React SPA)
├── Authentication Service
├── API Client
└── CDN-delivered assets

Backend Services
├── Web Server (API)
├── Database (PostgreSQL)
├── File Storage (AWS S3)
└── Authentication Provider

Infrastructure
├── Load Balancer
├── SSL Certificate
└── Monitoring/Analytics
```

## 🔄 Data Migration Strategy

### Current Data Structure (localStorage)
- Plant records with embedded base64 images
- Single-user, browser-specific storage
- No user accounts or authentication

### Production Data Model
```sql
Users Table:
- id, email, password_hash, created_at, subscription_tier

Plants Table:
- id, user_id, name, strain, origin, date_planted, 
  generation, mother_id, status, created_at

Plant_Images Table:
- id, plant_id, image_url, upload_date, is_primary

Plant_Diary_Entries Table:
- id, plant_id, entry_date, content

Harvest_Records Table:
- id, plant_id, harvest_date, weight, potency, notes
```

## 🛠️ Development Approach Options

### Option A: Full Custom Backend (Recommended for Scale)
**Technology**: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL + AWS
**Timeline**: 9-13 weeks
**Pros**: Full control, unlimited customization, cost-effective at scale
**Cons**: Longer development time, more complex deployment
**Cost**: $200-500/month at scale

### Option B: Backend-as-a-Service (Recommended for Speed)
**Technology**: React + Firebase/Supabase
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks
**Pros**: Faster development, automatic scaling, built-in features
**Cons**: Vendor lock-in, higher costs at scale
**Cost**: $100-800/month depending on usage

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
**Phase 1**: Launch with BaaS (6-8 weeks)
**Phase 2**: Migrate to custom backend when scaling demands require (additional 8-10 weeks)

## 🔐 Security & Compliance Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
- **User Registration**: Email verification required
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing, complexity requirements
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Authorization**: User can only access their own plants
- **Admin Access**: Separate admin interface for user management

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Input Validation**: Prevent SQL injection, XSS attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse and DDoS
- **GDPR Compliance**: User data export/deletion capabilities
- **Backup Strategy**: Daily automated backups with point-in-time recovery

### Advanced Security Measures
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Strict CSP headers to prevent XSS
- **CORS Configuration**: Environment-specific allowed origins
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party security assessments
- **Vulnerability Management**: Automated scanning with Snyk/npm audit
- **API Rate Limiting**: Per-user and per-endpoint limits
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options

## 🌐 Deployment Strategy

### Frontend Deployment
- **Hosting**: Netlify or Vercel for static site hosting
- **CDN**: Global content delivery for fast load times
- **SSL**: Automatic HTTPS certificate management
- **Custom Domain**: Professional branding (phenohunter.com)

### Backend Deployment
- **Container Strategy**: Docker containers for consistent deployment
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure
- **Database**: Managed database service for reliability
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 uptime monitoring and alerting

### CI/CD Pipeline
```
Developer Push
├── Automated Tests
├── **Automated Vulnerability Scanning (npm audit, Snyk)**
├── Security Scanning
├── Build Process
