---

## 🔒 Data & Security

### Input Security & Validation
- [ ] **All user inputs** sanitized and validated to prevent injection (XSS, HTML)
- [ ] Form validation includes both client-side and future server-side considerations
- [ ] File upload validation enforces safe file types and size limits
- [ ] No user input directly inserted into DOM without sanitization

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] **Auth protection** verified on all restricted routes/components
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials, tokens, or secrets in frontend code
- [ ] Login rate-limiting considerations documented for future backend
- [ ] Graceful handling of authentication failures and timeouts

### Data Storage Security
- [ ] **No sensitive data** (auth tokens, PII) stored in localStorage
- [ ] localStorage operations handle corruption and quota exceeded errors
- [ ] User data privacy considerations addressed and documented
- [ ] Data retention policies considered for stored information

### Third-Party Security
- [ ] **Third-party packages scanned** with `npm audit` (no high/critical vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Dependencies kept up-to-date with security patches
- [ ] No unused or deprecated packages in production build
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations documented for production

> **💡 Reference**: See `DEVELOPMENT_COMMANDS.md` for all security scanning commands

### Error Recovery & Security
- [ ] Network failure scenarios handled without exposing system details
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] User can recover from error states without data loss
- [ ] Graceful degradation when security features unavailable

---

## 📊 Performance & Optimization

### Performance
