# Phase 6: Advanced Plant Management - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Phase 6 focuses on implementing sophisticated plant lifecycle management, bulk operations, and advanced tracking features to provide professional-grade plant management capabilities.

## Core Features to Implement

### 1. Enhanced Plant Lifecycle Management
- **Growth Stage Tracking**: Seedling → Vegetative → Pre-flower → Flowering → Harvest
- **Automated Stage Transitions**: Time-based and manual triggers
- **Stage-specific Actions**: Different actions available per growth stage
- **Growth Timeline Visualization**: Visual progress tracking
- **Stage Duration Analytics**: Average time spent in each stage

### 2. Bulk Operations System
- **Multi-select Interface**: Checkbox selection with select-all functionality
- **Batch Actions**: Clone, harvest, delete, update status
- **Bulk Data Entry**: Mass update fields like nutrients, location, notes
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress for bulk operations
- **Undo/Redo Support**: Rollback bulk changes

### 3. Advanced Plant Details
- **Comprehensive Plant Profiles**: Extended information tracking
- **Growth Metrics**: Height, width, node count, branch count
- **Environmental Data**: Light schedule, temperature, humidity logs
- **Nutrient Tracking**: Feeding schedules and nutrient logs
- **Photo Timeline**: Progress photos with timestamps
- **Notes & Observations**: Rich text notes with tagging

### 4. Plant Relationships & Genetics
- **Parent-Child Tracking**: Clone genealogy trees
- **Phenotype Variations**: Track genetic expressions
- **Breeding Records**: Cross-pollination tracking
- **Genetic Lineage**: Family tree visualization
- **Trait Inheritance**: Track desirable characteristics

### 5. Smart Notifications & Reminders
- **Care Reminders**: Watering, feeding, pruning schedules
- **Stage Transition Alerts**: Automatic stage change notifications
- **Health Monitoring**: Problem detection and alerts
- **Harvest Reminders**: Optimal harvest time notifications
